ðŸ“Œ Second Task Completion

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my second task as part of my CodeAlpha internship!

ðŸ§® Project: Stock Prediction

ðŸ“Š Technologies Used: Python, Deep learning

In this project, I have predicted stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory networks, focusing on historical data of a leading company. This deep learning model captures complex patterns in time series data, offering a glimpse into the future of stock price movements.

Do have a look at [video presentation]() in my linkedIn post.
